This is a clone copy of Newsweek homepage.

The aim of this project is to produce an exact replica of the Newsweek homepage, focusing on responsiveness implemented with Twitter's Bootstrap framework. That means two things – using bootstrap CSS classes wherever possible (main point of this project) and double-checking that the page layout does not break on smaller screens.

## Built with

## Getting started
**I created a cloned copy of [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/) homepage. The main aim is to ensure that proper bootstrap classes are used to implement responsiveness, so functionality is not a priority.**

I used the browser’s developer tools to inspect the archived apple website to understand how elements are placed and styled.
I built my own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. I carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
  - Then open the [web page](https://www.newsweek.com/), inspect its features with browser's developer tools and start creating  :shipit:
